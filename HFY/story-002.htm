			The Roak leave me no choice.<br>
			Lllarkerh ran off after our little chat, and I've been informed that he's not attending the coalition session.<br>
			Guess it's time for a second first impression.

			[PERIOD 15 - MOMENT 350] Personal message from Human ambassador Tom Alberto to Human fauna and biology
			<br><br>
			Frank,<br>
			Publish Human biology documents at period 16, moment 30.<br>
			Physical section only, high priority.<br>
			Send a copy to the Oba ambassador in advance.
			<br><br>
			- Tom
		</p>
		<p>
			Hopefully I've timed that right.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>As I'm making my way towards the session chamber, I'm gretted by the Oba ambassador, and my close friend, Loe.
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>Hey, I heard what happened.<br>Seems like Lark saw fit to drink himself to sleep!</speech></p>
		<speech class="firstperson">
			Hah, and here I was thinking he could hold his own!<br>
			Your own brew by any chance?
		</speech>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			Finest brewers in the galaxy!
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			I've been meaning to try their drinks, I've heard good things from some of my generals.<br><br>
			Loe looks at me, with slight confusion.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			Do you have something planned for the session?<br>
			I can't help but notice that extra spring in your step.
		</speech></p>
		<p>Observant, as always. Either that, or she can read me like a book by now.</p>
		<speech class="firstperson">I plan on revealing something special, you should have the documents shortly.</speech>
		<p>
			Any moment now...<br>
			<i>Ping!</i>
		</p>
		<speech class="firstperson">Section 4.</speech>
		<p>
			I didn't plan on meeting Loe on the way, but when the opportunity presents itself, you can't say no.
			<br><br>
			Loe dutifully opens up the documents clearly titled [HUMAN BIOLOGY - PHYSICAL].
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>Are you sure?</speech></p>
		<speech class="firstperson">Trust me.</speech>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>I always do, even when I shouldn't.</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe is clearly intruiged, but as she reads, her eyes widen.<br>
			I can't blame her of course, that section details our bone and muscle structure, and she's quite the biologist.<br>
			It also conveniently states impact resistance and exertable force.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>I...You...You're capable of this?</speech></p>
		<speech class="firstperson">Yes, any questions?</speech>
		<p>She's handling it quite well, all things considered.</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			It's...Wow. This changes things.<br>
			Lark must've had a front row seat?
		</speech></p>
		<speech class="firstperson">You could say that.</speech>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>Article 73a?</speech></p>
		<speech class="firstperson">Any objections?</speech>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>Not if I get a front row seat. Give them hell.</speech></p>
		<p>She really can read me like a book. This should be fun.</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>
			We enter the chamber side by side, Loe wearing a smugness unusual for someone who just got hit hard by raids.<br>
			The Roak seem not to notice, they're too busy boasting about their "glorious combat" against civilians.<br><br>
			Absolute filth, the lot of them. I'd be lying to myself if I thought this was for the betterment of other species.<br>
			I have vengeance to enact.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>I still think it's strange that you're the only Human who comes to these.</speech></p>
		<p>
			As we take our seats, it looks like Loe got her wish. Front row.<br>
			Some of the other Oda ask her questions. She smiles, looks at me, and says something I can't make out.<br>
			A Roak general takes the podium in the centre, and raises one hand. The chatter quickly fades.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<p class="noperson">Roak general:<speech>
			As Lllarkerh is unable to attend, I will be acting as the Roak ambassador for this session.<br>
			The Roak have made their demands clear to the Oda, we covet the systems their colonies are in and we will continue to take payment until the issue is resolved.<br>
			If the Oda are willing to negotiate, please step forth.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Most of the species present nod, a standard session so far. All eyes are on Loe.<br>
			She grins, and this time the Roak notice. One of them elbows another, and mutters something.<br>
			Loe tries to force down any enthusiasm in her voice, and for the most part succeeded.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			The Oda call upon the defensive treaty established in 17311 with the Humans.<br>
			Due to the attack on our colonies, and unnecessary loss of life, we consider the actions a declaration of war.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			The other species present gasp, the Roak grin and look in my direction, and the other Oda are sitting in stunned disbelief.<br>
			The Oda closest to her look at me, looking for the source of her new-found confidence.
			<br><br><br>
			Showtime.
		</p>
		<speech class="firstperson">
			The Humans acknowledge the defensive treaty, and also consider this a declaration of war.<br>
			As per Article 73a, we offer one chance for the Roak to renege on their claims and make amends.
		</speech>
		<p>
			Most of the Roak break out into laughter. I am, after all, Prey with a 1.4 threat. For now, at least.<br>
			I glance at my watch, period 16 moment 29.<br>
			Loe appears to be showing the other Oda something, presumably our biology.<br>
			A <i>Ping!</i> echoes through the room, as the other ambassadors receive the documents.
		</p>
		<br>
		<speech class="firstperson">
			We have also published biological information to allow the Roak to make an informed decision.<br>
			We urge you to examine this before continuing.
		</speech>
		<p>
			Some of the Roak in the back start looking at their portable computers. Notably, their biologist.<br>
			However, it looks like she won't have time.
			<br><br>
			The Roak general, almost frothing at the mouth at such an opportunity, start bellowing with a massive grin on his face.
		</p>
		<p class="noperson">Roak general:<speech>
			We accept your challenge as per Article 73a, and will gladly take your lands as well as those of the Oda!<br>
			May the best predator win!
		</speech></p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Article 73a is a simple document, often exploited by the Roak when they're on the receiving end of raids.<br>
			No other species had dared use it. No other species would survive.<br>
			Put simply, it demands that the aggressor fights the defendant in a one-on-one match in front of an assembly.<br>
			Should the aggressor refuse, or lose, the defendant is free to make demands as an ultimatum.<br>
			In this case, the session will suffice as an assembly.
			<br><br>
			Seems like he's eager to start, too, given that he just threw the podium to one side. It lands with a <i>Thunk</i>.<br>
			I stand, remove my tie, and head towards the newly formed clearing.
		</p>
		<speech class="firstperson">May the best predator win.</speech>
		<br><br><br>
		<p>
			As luck would have it, Loe was chosen to initiate our match.<br>
			I suppose the Roak think this is punishment for her insolence, but she's relishing the opportunity.<br>
			The Oda are watching intently, whilst the other species are talking amongst themselves.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			Are the combatants ready?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Roak general:<speech>
			Ready!
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			A quick glance to the Roak biologist confirms my suspicions.<br>
			Our eyes meet, and I let out a toothy grin. She starts sweating, unable to look away.
		</p>
		<speech class="firstperson">Ready.</speech>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			Begin!
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe hurries out of way, just in time to avoid the general's first swipe at me.<br>
			I quickly jump back, barely escaping having a horrid scar across my face.<br>
			They really don't mess around, do they? He presses, swipe after swipe, but I'm faster.<br>
			Each one misses more than the last as he falls into a predictable pattern.
			<br><br>
			His feet start to line up, a clear change in tactic. Finally. He's going for a punch.<br>
			I can clearly see where it's going, but I'm here to make a point, and I let it hit my face.<br>
			<i>CRUNCH</i><br>
			I take a step back, slightly dazed, but the general fared far worse.
		</p>
		<p class="noperson">Roak general:<speech>
			AAAAAAAHHH!!
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Looks like his hand is broken.<br>
			It's dangerous for another Human to go for the face, but for another species, it's a guarantee.<br>
			Our bones are three times as dense as theirs.
		</p>
		<br>
		<speech class="firstperson">Is that the best you've got?</speech>
		<p>
			Having the intended effect, the general blindly charges into me, in an attempt to pin me down.<br>
			I meet his charge, shoulder for shoulder. I hear his pop out, and he lets out another scream of pain.<br>
			As I look towards the Roak, I can see the disbelief and horror present.<br>
			The biologist knows what's coming, and makes for the exit. Not that I can blame her.
		</p>
		<br>
		<speech class="firstperson">Let me show you real strength.</speech>
		<p>I duck under his arms and grab him by the waist, the stench is awful. Do they not bathe?</p>
		<speech class="firstperson">Rrraaaahh!</speech>
		<p>
			With a quick heave, I have him firmly on my shoulder. He scrapes at my back with his working arm.<br>
			I grit my teeth, he's managed to land a firm strike on my back, and I'm pretty sure I'm bleeding.<br>
			I toss him back down, angling to have him land flat on his back. He's knocked out by the impact.
			<br><br>
			With that out the way, I make my way back to my seat, taking in the shock still present on everyone's faces.<br>
			Everyone except Loe, that is.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			The Oda appreciate your assistance in the matter.
		</speech></p>
		<speech class="firstperson">We have a treaty to uphold.</speech>
		<p>
			I give a quick nod to Loe, put my tie back on, and take my seat once more.<br>
			Let's see how far this goes, I'd love to take some of our new toys out for a spin.<br>
			Loe, now without a podium, simply stands in the centre of the room.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			Roak, as per Article 73a, you will return all stolen goods to the Oda.<br>
			In addition, you will provide the necessary support to restore our colonies to working order.<br>
			Finally, systems QF-516-A and QF-516-D are considered part of Oda territory, and shall be ceded.<br>
			Failure to accept our demands will be considered a declaration of war.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe is playing hard-ball, those systems aren't even close. Almost like she wants a war.<br>
			One of the Roak stands, looks like a captain. Guess he's third in command.<br>
			He checks something on his portable computer, and fear quickly turns to rage.
		</p>
		<p class="noperson">Roak captain:<speech>
			Preposterous!<br>
			Those systems aren't anywhere near your territory!<br>
			How can you expect us to agree to these terms?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			Very well, the Oda declare a defensive war against the Roak.
		</speech></p>
		<speech class="firstperson">The Humans declare a defensive war against Roak.</speech>
		<p>She definitely wants a war, and it looks like I get to play with my toys after all.</p>
