		<p>
			Tom and Loe had been laying there for at least a couple periods, with Loe completely absorbed in music and Tom enjoying the second-hand feeling. Unfortunately for Tom, he needed to relieve himself.<br>
			He goes to stand up, but finds his hand still firmly attached, usually Loe realises.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			Uh, Loe?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			...huh?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			I, uh, need my hand back.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe lethargically looks at where Tom's hand is, and takes several seconds to release it.<br>
			Tom had intended to look somewhat concerned, but his body dutifully reminded him why he got up in the first place. He heads into his bathroom.<br>
			<i>Ping!</i> Tom could swear this always happens, it's always at an inopportune time.<br>
			Once he's done in the bathroom, he comes back out and checks the message.

			[PERIOD 11 - MOMENT 205] Personal message from Bolo ambassador Arjay Roloho to Human ambassador Tom Alberto
			<br><br>
			Tom,<br>
			I require a meeting, please inform me when you are back on the station.
			<br><br>
			- Arjay
		</p>
		<p>
			Tom sighs, he had planned a longer venture. He reaches over and shuts off the music player for the time being.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			Loe, it's time we headed back, duty calls.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe's face portrays her mild indignation, her session interrupted mid-song.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			Do we have to?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			The Bolo ambassador wants to have a chat, I assume it's pretty important.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe quietly mutters 'Bolo' to herself a few times, seemingly trying to recall something.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			Oh, Arjay! Did he mention why?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			Not really, but this is the first time I've been asked for a meeting, usually it's the other way around.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			They're quite peaceful, I doubt they want to offer their help with the Roak.<br>
			What else could it be?
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom starts looking grim. They hadn't let on much, to other species they should appear inferior.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			It's possible they know where we are.<br>
			I think we need answers, immediately.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom starts typing out a response, as they both start making their way back to the Scuttlebug.
		</p>
		<p class="console">
			[PERIOD 8 - MOMENT 343] Personal message from Human ambassador Tom Alberto to Bolo ambassador Arjay Roloho
			<br><br>
			RJ,<br>
			I will be available in two days, please advise about the nature of the meeting.
			<br><br>
			- Tom
		</p>
		<p>
			Hopefully that's enough to spur a response.
			<br><br>
			Tom makes a quick diversion to inform Jackson that they're heading out, before entering the hangar.<br>
			They board the Scuttlebug, it wordlessly activates and starts slowly charging its capacitor banks.<br>
			Once charged, it silently undocks, and their 40 period return trip is underway.<br>
			Tom reaches for the music player.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			I think it'd be better not to, do you have something else we could do instead?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			Hm, I might have something.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom pulls out a board from one of the cabinets, along with two bowls.<br>
			The board has a grid pattern on it, and the bowls have round stones. One has black stones, one has white.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			This is Go, the rules are fairly simple but the vast number of options makes it quite complex.<br>
			This is also a smaller board. Normally you use a 19x19 board, but for now we can play on a 9x9 board.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom hands Loe a rule-book, and Loe begins reading it. Immediately, some questions arise.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			Liberties?
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom lays out four black stones in a 2x2 pattern on the board.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			This is a group of stones, each empty space is a liberty. This group has 8.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom starts adding white stones around the black group.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			Occupying those liberties initially does nothing, but-
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom adds the last white stone, filling all 8 open spaces around the black stones.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			-once a group has no liberties, it dies. If you were white, you would get 4 points, plus another 4 for the space you now hold.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			Hm, ok. What about Ko?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			Basically, you can't have the same board layout appear twice in one game.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom collects the existing stones, and places 4 black stones around an empty space.<br>
			Tom then adds three white stones around one of the black stones, and points at it.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			This black stone could be captured with one white stone.<br>
			It's important to note that, whilst the new white stone has no liberties, because it captures a black stone you're allowed to place it.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom places the white stone inside the black stones, and removes the black stone he pointed at.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			See how white is in the same situation now?<br>
			Black could just capture the white stone right back, however that would put us back where we started, which isn't allowed.<br>
			White has to play somewhere else first, allowing black the chance to prevent the capture, before white can do so.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			Alright, I think I understand everything.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom puts the stones back in their respective bowls, and hands the bowl of white stones to Loe.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			Black goes first, but white gets 6.5 points to compensate for this.<br>
			The half-point prevents ties.
		</speech></p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Tom and Loe sit in relative silence, playing several games of Go.<br>
			At first, the games are horribly one-sided in favour of Tom, but Loe gradually catches on and they start having fairly close games.<br>
			After the 7th game, Loe seems somewhat frustrated.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			What am I missing?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			You're too attached to your groups, sometimes you have to let one die for profit elsewhere.<br>
			Sometimes it's also worthwhile to make groups you know will die, if it means your opponent has to spend a lot of moves to deal with it.<br>
			We can continue later, I need some rest.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom settles in for his nights rest, leaving Loe to her thoughts.<br>
			<br><br>
			Once Tom is awake, he grabs a ready-made meal and pulls out the stones, along with a 13x13 board.<br>
			After a few more games, Loe starts getting incredibly close, the 13th being lost by a mere half point.<br>
			Halfway into the 14th game, Tom lets out a chuckle.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			What?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			I think you've won this one, by 2.5 points. I could be wrong, though.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			You're that certain this early on?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			No, but I'm having a hard time finding a way forward.<br>
			I <i>could</i> make trouble in that group, but I don't see how I get anything out of it.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom points to one of Loe's groups as he's talking.<br>
			The next period features particularly intense fighting across the board, but Tom doesn't seem impressed.<br>
			Sure enough, Loe won the 14th game, by 1.5 points.<br>
			Tom goes to set up the next game when the capacitors discharge, signalling they're on the last leg of their journey. A look at the timer confirms it, 2 periods left.
			<br><br>
			Tom starts typing a message, and realises he never got a reply from Arjay.
		</p>
		<p class="console">
			[PERIOD 21 - MOMENT 9] Personal message from Human ambassador Tom Alberto to Bolo ambassador Arjay Roloho
			<br><br>
			RJ,<br>
			I will arrive in roughly two periods.
			<br><br>
			- Tom
		</p>
		<p>
			Tom tries to suppress his concern, but Loe notices.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			What did he say?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			He never replied, which means it was either urgent, or that he doesn't trust the coalition.<br>
			Failing that, he could be missing.
		</speech></p>
		<p><i>Ping!</i></p>
		<p class="console">
			[PERIOD 21 - MOMENT 11] Personal message from Bolo ambassador Arjay Roloho to Human ambassador Tom Alberto
			<br><br>
			Tom,<br>
			I'll be in my quarters.
			<br><br>
			- Arjay
		</p>
		<p>
			Tom starts rubbing his temples, as he strains to think of alternatives.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			Is it possible he wants to make sure you're not working with the Roak?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			Why would he think that?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			You did hold back during that session, it's fairly obvious once you start looking at the footage.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			I guess that makes sense.<br>
			We should have time for one more game.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			The final game appears to be going in Tom's favour, but it's cut short by their arrival at the station.<br>
			Tom pulls out his personal computer, records the position, and notes that it's Loe's turn.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			We'll come back to that one.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			A soft grumble comes out of Loe, she knows she's not winning it.
			<br><br>
			Tom suddenly appears stressed, and holds out a hand for Loe.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			Need to show me something?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			I can't think of a word.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Confusion spreads across Loe as she takes his hand, and an image of something similar-looking to the Bolo appears.<br>
			It's not quite the same, the eyes are smaller and the nose is more pronounced.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Loe:<speech>
			Er, weird Bolo?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Tom:<speech>
			They're similar to an animal we have on Earth.<br>
			God, what is it...<br>
			Meerkats! They're like meerkats.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe starts laughing as they enter Arjay's quarters, and Loe releases Tom's hand.
		</p>
		<p class="noperson">Arjay:<speech>
			Please close the door, I'd rather not have anyone else hearing.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe stops laughing, and Tom starts eyeing up Arjay. The atmosphere is quite tense.
			<br><br>
			Tom closes the door.
