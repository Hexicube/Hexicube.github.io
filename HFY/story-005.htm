			Perspective: Romov<br>
		</p>
		<hr><br>
		<p>
			Romov couldn't wait to show off, but Tom was busy droning on about how his oh-so-useful QX works.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			-this is the safety latch, the gun won't fire unless it's set to "live".
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			Alright, I still don't know what it does though.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Right.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			That shut him up, Loe knows what she's doing around Tom. Romov starts to wonder if his arm is related.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			All you really have to do is point it at what you want to hit, and pull the trigger.<br>
			It's just like a plasma rifle, except smaller.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			He aims at the closest target 50m out.<br>
			<i>Pop!</i> Loe flinches at the sound, but it's nothing compared to what's coming later.<br>
			A couple cm to the left, Romov quickly exhales out of her nose.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Romov, if you have something to say, say it.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Romov:<speech>
			I thought we were supposed to impress Loe?
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Jackson desperately tries to conceal his laughter, amazingly Tom doesn't notice...or he has a great poker face.
			<br><br>
			Tom hands his QX to Loe.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Here, you try it.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			What? No! I'm just observing!
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Did you really think this was just a show and tell?<br>
			I want the Oda to be as prepared as possible for this war, which means you're going to use my QX so we can work out if it's suitable.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			I...I suppose that makes sense.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe gingerly aims at the 50m target, and slows her breathing.<br>
			<i>Pop!</i> Dead centre, and everyone is momentarily stunned, Tom's going to be chastised for this later.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			You're a natural!
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe starts examining the QX, as if to glean what she can, before quickly pointing at the 100m target.<br>
			<i>Pop!</i> Dead centre again.<br>
			<i>Pop!</i> 250m, a couple mm low.<br>
			<i>Pop!</i> 500m, dead centre, having compensated for gravity.
		</p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			This is great! It's so easy!
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom starts laughing, Romov and Jackson are just staring like a deer in headlights.<br>
			She shoots better than any Human. Faster, too.<br>
			<i>Pop Pop Pop!</i> Three more perfect shots, in rapid succession, all on the 500m target.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			You're better than all of us...
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			What?
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Confused, Loe looks at Romov and Jackson, and realises just how surprised they are.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Romov, you're the best shot out of the rest of us, why don't you try and match her?
		</speech></p>
		<p>He did that on purpose, after his god-awful 50m shot.</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Romov:<speech>
			Don't think for a second I'm going to let you get away with how well <i>you</i> performed.
		</speech></p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Romov pulls out her own QX, checks the chamber and magazine, flicks off the safety, and aims for 250m.<br>
			<i>Pop!</i> A hair to the right.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Not bad, but Loe's better.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Romov:<speech>
			Shut it!
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Romov aims at 500m, and breathes slowly. Romov doesn't want to be out-done by an ambassador, an <i>alien</i>.<br>
			<i>Pop!</i> Dead centre, an even match so far. Romov moves to 750m, and relaxes once more.<br>
			<i>Pop!</i> Barely high.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Romov:<speech>
			Think you can match that?
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe smiles, and does her best fake sarcasm voice.
		</p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			<i>Oh, I dunno...that's soooo far...</i>
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Without a second thought, she casually aims at 1000m instead of 750m.<br>
			<i>Pop!</i> Dead centre yet again.<br>
			Jackson bursts out laughing, and collapses in his fit of hysteria.<br>
			Tom has the biggest shit-eating grin Romov has ever seen.<br>
			Romov is, understandably, miffed. She tries to maintain a neutral voice, and shifts the subject.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="firstperson">Romov:<speech>
			Since Jackson is...preoccupied, we can skip his little toy and move on to the main course.<br>
			This is the LB-SA, or as I like to call it, the Longbow.<br>
			5+1 capacity, semi-auto, 50x scope, and it can tear you a new one from up to 20km.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe can tell she wants to show off, having already failed once, but lets Romov have her fun for a moment.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Romov:<speech>
			You may want to cover your ears.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom dons some earmuffs, hands one to Romov, and tosses one at Jackson. Tom also offers one to Loe.
		</p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			I, uh, technically don't have ears.<br>
			I hear with my entire body.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Romov knows Loe said something, but with the earmuffs on, she doesn't know what it was.<br>
			All she knows is that Loe is uninterested in hearing protection, and lines up her shot on the 5km target.<br>
			Romov tweaks the scope, adjusting for the shorter-than-usual range.<br>
			The targets beyond 2km are thicker, and a screen shows where on the target a given shot landed.<br>
			<i>'15 zoom, 5 range, relax. Relax...'</i> Romov thinks to herself.<br>
			<i><b>BOOM!</b></i> The target shatters, leaving shrapnel everywhere, and a new one takes its place.<br>
			After half a second, the screen lights up with a green indicator. 1mm to the right, not bad for a standing shot.
			<br><br>
			Loe starts realising the implications of this kind of warfare.
		</p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			I can barely see the target you hit, is this what it's like to be in a war on Earth?<br>
			One minute you're sitting in an outpost looking for hostiles, and the next you're dead?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Romov:<speech>
			Something like that.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Alright, how about something to eat?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			Um...
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			I'll make sure you don't get anything...unsuitable.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Romov thought the Oda could eat anything, they certainly look like they could.<br>
			Romov starts packing up her Longbow. Jackson huffs, and prepares to take a few shots of his own.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Jackson:<speech>
			I'll have something later, I need to get some practice in.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom waves on his way out, but Jackson is busy lining up.<br>
			<i>B-B-Bang!</i> He loves using burst fire, but it's such a waste of ammo...<br>
			<br><br>
			As they're making their way to the mess hall, Romov figures this is probably the best time for a few answers.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Romov:<speech>
			So what's up with your arm?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			This?
		</speech></p>
		<p>Tom wiggles his burnt arm slightly.</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			I'll defer to Loe on that one.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			Can I trust her?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			That's up to you, but I trust her.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			I can...um...
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe obviously doesn't trust Romov, Romov knows she isn't going to get the full picture.<br>
			The question is, how much will she get?
		</p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			I can share thoughts with another being, and allow them to share theirs with me.<br>
			I'd shown Tom on the way here, he took the chance to show me the problem with plasma rifles, and you've since cemented that.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Romov can tell she's trying to deflect, something happened on the way here. He's never arrived awake before.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Romov:<speech>
			That sounds interesting, and useful.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			Yes, well...<br>
			The reason his arm is like that is because I had to remove the top layer of skin in order to...connect with him.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			It's really not an issue.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Romov:<speech>
			How bad is it?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Felt like sunburn at first, but it's fine now.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			<br><br>
			A gentle waft of steak makes its way to the three of them, disrupting their train of thought.<br>
			Tom and Romov are excited, but Loe looks somewhat uneasy.<br>
			As they round the next corner, they find themselves in the mess hall, about a quarter of them notice Loe and momentarily stop eating.<br>
			Looks like there's plenty left.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			I know you said you're not a fan of meat, but this is lab-grown and should have no nerve endings.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Romov:<speech>
			Nerve endings?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			I don't have a choice with melding...uh, connecting, with other beings.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Can you at least try some?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			I...ok. This is your fault if it's a problem.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom heads over to the canteen to procure three meals, Romov motions Loe to an empty table nearby.<br>
			They sit in silence for a couple seconds, before Romov lets out a sigh.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Romov:<speech>
			Did Tom let you do that to him?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			Yes...I wouldn't do it without his consent.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe is somewhat embarrased about it, but it's an honest answer. It's not the whole truth, though.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Romov:<speech>
			What did you share with Tom?<br>
			What did he share with you?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			I don't-
		</speech></p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Tom arrives in time to spare Loe further awkwardness, and shoves a meal in front of her.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Here! Steak, peas, mash, and gravy! Go on, try it!
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom sets the jug of gravy down in the middle of the table, and starts working on his own meal.<br>
			Loe prods the mash, before taking a small chunk and testing it. She's satisfied, and tries it dipped in gravy.<br>
			Both seem to be fine, given that Loe took the chance to smother her meal.<br>
			Next, the peas come under scrutiny. Apparantly they're easy to discern, and they go straight in.
		</p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			It's nice, reminds me of home. Fresh, too.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			We have a greenhouse on-board, frozen veg is awful.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe turns her attention to the steak taunting her on her plate.<br>
			Tom takes the opportunity to take a chunk out of his, and enjoys it.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			They did a good job this time, you got lucky.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			Hah...yeah...
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe slowly carves out a tiny piece, trying to minimise the amount she's forced to eat before she can declare it to be awful.<br>
			She carefully lifts the piece of steak to herself, closes her eyes, and shoves it in.<br>
			Her eyes open again, her face contorted with confusion, she was expecting a problem but got something else.<br>
			Tom smiles at her.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Like I said, lab-grown.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			I prefer the peas, but it's nice.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Romov smirks, she can't help but think that they look like a cute couple, even if Loe is a massive slug.
