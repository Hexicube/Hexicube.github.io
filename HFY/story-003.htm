			Tom has been typing away on his portable computer for some time now, almost singular in his focus.<br>
			He'd repeatedly insisted to Loe that "I want to show you something", but gave no indication of what that was.<br>
			Finally, after what felt like hours, he broke the silence.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			You should get a message shortly, it will explain everything.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			You're being awfully vague...well, more than usual.
		</speech></p>

			[PERIOD 16 - MOMENT 712] Confidential message from The Endurance to Oda ambassador Loe
			<br><br>
			Loe,<br>
			After careful consideration, you have been granted access to all areas of The Endurance.<br>
			You will find your official documentation attached, as well as your authorization codes.<br>
			If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask.<br><br>
			- Captain Riker
		</p>
		<p>
			Loe was only more confused by this. What was The Endurance? Was she now a combatant for the Human military? Was she expected to fight alongside them?
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			I don't understand.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom, careful not to have anyone else hear, leans in and speaks softly.
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			The Endurance is a battlecruiser, it's sitting at the edge of the system.<br>
			I'm going to show you some of our war tech, I want your people to be as armed as possible for the conflict that will surely follow.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			I see.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			A battlecruiser? Loe hadn't heard that class of ship before, but now she understood the secrecy.<br>
			Tom probably doesn't want anyone else knowing they have cutting-edge tech just sitting there, practically already in their hands.<br>
			She still doesn't know what's expected of her, but that can wait.<br><br>
			Loe realises that, given the distance, they're going to have hours alone.<br>
			Ideal circumstances, she'd wanted to show Tom her big secret for some time now.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			How long will it take to get there?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Since we need to be discrete, I would say 40 periods.
		</speech></p>
		<p>Over a day and a half, more than enough time.</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			Will we be alone?
		</speech></p>
		<p>Tom raises an eyebrow at this, it has to look quite suspicious from his view.</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Do you have something planned?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			A secret for a secret. You'll see.
		</speech></p>
		<br><br>
		<p>
			Loe and Tom both enter Tom's shuttle ship, emblazened with "Scuttlebug" on the side.<br>
			Loe notices that there's been a few odd changes, most notably a switch on the ship's beacon.<br>
			Covert indeed, can't be having anyone tracking your exact movements.<br><br>
			Tom powers up the ship, it's strangely quiet, almost haunting.<br>
			No deep hum of the drives, but it can still be felt. The lights are not bright white, but dim blue.<br>
			The large capacitors in the back start charging. They're absurdly oversized, but Tom probably wants to shut off the generator during the trip.<br><br>
			With everything set into motion, the ship lurches out of the docking bay, heading in the wrong direction altogether. For now.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Autopilot is on, Scuttlebug will fly out and fake a hyperjump once the capacitors are charged before heading towards The Endurance.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			Perfect.<br>
			I've wanted to show you this for a while, but it requires a completely safe environment. If we're separated, the results are fatal for both of us.<br>
			The Oda have the ability to...integrate with other species.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom's face scrunches up, as he goes into deep thought.<br>
			He needn't think so hard about intentions, it will become clear.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			We call it Melding, the best way of describing it is that it allows us to share our thoughts, feelings, and memories.
		</speech></p>
		<p>Tom quickly exhales, clearly he had something worse on his mind.</p>
		<br><br>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			How much control would I have?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			Tom, I want to be as clear as possible before we start, if I wanted I could forcibly take control of you.<br>
			I have no desire to do so, you will be completely in control up to a certain level of melding.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Curiousity spreads across his face. Loe knows he's going to agree, but she still has to put him at ease first.<br>
			Loe realises she's forgot to mention something important.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			A certain level of melding?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			I should first note that the process can be quite painful to start. I have to expose nerves.<br>
			Given your biology, you would heal after a few days.<br>
			I would be burning off the top layer of skin, but that would be enough to gain access.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			I can handle that.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			At first I'll only be melding via your finger, enough to share basic emotions only.<br>
			As long as you remain comfortable, I'll slowly continue melding.<br>
			Once I envelop your hand, we would share full emotions and surface level thoughts, as if we were telepathic.
		</speech></p>
		<br>
		<p>He's absolutely interested.<br>Loe can see it, and as far as she's concerned, she may as well paint the full picture in advance.</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			At your elbow, we would be able to share mental images, as well as memories.<br>
			At your shoulder, we would have full access to one-another, being capable of exploring each-others memories unchecked.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			That sounds...intense. Is it dangerous?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			No, but we would both be changed.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Is this why the Oda are herbivores?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			Yes, we don't have a choice with melding.<br>
			Any exposed nerves are connected to.<br>
			Our attempts at eating animals were not pleasant.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe begins extending an appendage, shaped roughly like a finger but inverted at the tip.<br>
			Loe needs to show him this, it had been burning inside her for years. He needs to see her for what she really is.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			When you're ready.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom sighs, extends his finger, inhales, and grits his teeth, before finally making contact.<br>
			A short gasp escapes Tom as Loe begins eating her way through, searching for nerve endings to mingle with.<br>
			She finds some, and now feels the intense pain Tom feels from having his finger burned.<br>
			She also gasps, her breathing now ragged and shallow.
			<br><br>
			After what feels like hours, but was more like 5 seconds, the pain subsides.<br>
			There's a vague sense of wonder flooding out of Tom. No fear, no concern, just child-like wonder.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			What do you feel?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			I feel...larger. Like I've found another part of myself.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			Can you feel my emotions?
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			You're...happy. In what way I can't be sure, but it's there.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			He's not wrong.
			<br><br>
			Loe slowly begins to spread, now covering three fingers and some of his hand.
		</p>
		<p class="noperson">Tom:<speech>
			This is amazing, so much more emotion sitting in reach...
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			I'm glad you think so, your sense of wonder is quite enjoyable.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Tom:<speech>
			Woah...
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Child-like wonder, a desire for more, admiration of what the Oda can do. It's all there.<br>
			She's waited too long to experience another species, but the pay-off was worth it.<br>
			She continues spreading, now reaching about halfway down his forearm.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			I'm surprised you don't feel pain from this.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Tom:<speech>
			I do, but...oh...
		</speech></p>
		<p>Loe knows what he found, it's what she wanted him to know.</p>
		<p class="noperson">Tom:<speech>
			My god...you're ancient!
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Loe:<speech>
			You could say that.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="noperson">Tom:<speech>
			I...but...I can see memories a millenia old!<br>
			I can see...I can see so much...
		</speech></p>
		<p>Loe was growing concerned, she hadn't even reached his elbow and he could already dive back millenia.</p>
		<p class="noperson">Tom:<speech>
			No, it's fine, keep going.
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			A brief glance was exchanged between them, and they moved in tandem to a more comfortable spot.<br>
			They would be here for an hour or two, and they both understood that he'd lose the ability to stand.
			<br><br>
			As Loe reaches his elbow, Tom briefly enters a state of shock, his breathing abruptly stops for a moment.<br>
			Tom can feel it now. He can feel her memories. All of them.<br>
			Memories stretching back over the ages, before Humans were even Humans to begin with.<br>
			Loe wasn't just ancient, she was millions of years old, and yet 500 years ago she couldn't make bronze.<br>
			He understands now that Oda aren't born, they never have been.<br>
			When more are needed, Loe subdivides, the memories imparted onto both.<br>
			When the population is too high, they starve themselves and merge, becoming one again.<br>
			Every single Oda was one and the same, they were all Loe.<br>
			They all share memories frequently, no wonder they advanced so quickly.
			<br><br>
			Meanwhile, Loe is having her own existential crisis, Humans are the exact opposite of her.<br>
			Tom has so few memories, and yet so vivid.<br>
			Her own memories were fleeting glances of the past. A vague painting, hastily done in minutes by a shoddy artist with somewhere to be.<br>
			His memories were sometimes that, but other times they were clear as day, dripping with emotion.<br>
			Intense joy when his girlfriend of 10 years finally proposed, he had said yes immediately.<br>
			A distinct smell of cinnamon fills the air. A gentle breeze, a warm summer day.<br>
			Contemptness, when they relaxed in bed together, thinking of the years past as well to come.<br>
			His feet are cold, poking out from the quilt, but his left arm is warm, residing under her.
			<br><br>
			Confusion and sadness, with hope in the mix, doctors have found a tumerous growth. The air turns cold.<br>
			Anger with no target, and despair. It's cancer, terminal, she has weeks.<br>
			The smell of cinnamon returns, but burnt. Tainted by the foul intrusion.<br>
			Complete emptiness, devoid of emotion. She's gone. Tom is sitting in his bedroom, the flowery wallpaper now grey, the sun shining a somber light into his room, no colour finds its way in. There's no smell.<br>
			A flood of determination, he has to do something, anything. He signs up for the army. The ink shimmers under lamplight as he signs his full name, Tom Robert Alberto.<br>
			Anger, tinged with amusement, one of the other cadets stole his boots. He'd find them soon enough.<br>
			Excitement, he was offered a trip to Mars. It would be the 17th trip, they needed people to help terraforming operations, and he was a good pilot. He sees a fresh start.<br>
			Surprise, he's intercepted on-route by an unknown ship. An Oda ship. It's Loe.
			<br><br>
			Static, Loe find herself unable to go deeper.
		</p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			I...
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe begins to remove herself from Tom, revealing first-degree burns across his entire forearm and hand.<br>
			It will heal in due time, but for now Tom would have to deal with the unpleasantness.<br>
			Loe can't contain her excitement, it was like living a whole other life.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			Your memories are so rich, I never thought that such intense moments could be preserved like that!
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			You're quite the enigma yourself, to think that you're over a million years old...
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Loe realises she's rather deeply intruded on his memories, she stopped paying attention once the first wave of intense emotion hit.<br>
			She really hopes Tom isn't against further exploration, and perhaps actually becoming one for a short while.<br>
			Tom looks exhausted. She thinks she's ruined her chances, getting drunk on his emotions.
		</p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			I...I must apologise, I lost control once I started feeling your memories.<br>
			I fear that I may not have stopped.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			It's alright, I just need to rest.<br>
			We can continue some other time.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="firstperson">Loe:<speech>
			Great, I had fun.
		</speech></p>
		<p class="thirdperson">Tom:<speech>
			Me too. Me too...
		</speech></p>
		<p>
			Tom lies down on the hard floor, and just like that, he's out cold.<br>
			Loe has a lot to think about, but fortunately, she doesn't need sleep.<br>
			She glances at the autopilot.

			Had they really been melding for over a day?
